## My music portfolio website

###### Built from the Kube template by Rometheme.

My first project in a few years that I haven't used a backend for. I wanted to simulate the process of doing a template customization for a client with minimal to no backend functionality.

#### Email Form

Email form functionality will be implemented through the use of the API already built on my web development portfolio. Axios will be used to make a POST request to that API and send the email from the contact form.
